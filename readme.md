# QA Selector Helper

## Overview

The QA Selector Helper is a simple browser tool designed to assist Quality Assurance engineers and developers in identifying and copying various CSS selectors for web elements. It provides an interactive way to inspect elements on a demo page, view their potential selectors, and copy them to the clipboard.

This tool is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and includes a demo page to showcase its functionality.

## Features

*   **Scan Visible Selectors:** Analyzes the page (specifically elements with IDs in the current version) and lists them in the helper popup.
*   **Hover Mode:** Enables an overlay and tooltip that displays selector information for the element currently under the mouse cursor.
*   **Element Inspector Tooltip:** Shows detailed selector information:
    *   Tag Name
    *   ID
    *   Classes
    *   Full CSS Path
    *   Data Attributes
*   **Pin Tooltip:** Allows the user to "pin" the tooltip to the currently hovered element, keeping its information visible even when the mouse moves away.
*   **Copy Selectors:** Easily copy individual selectors to the clipboard with a single click from the tooltip or the scanned list.
*   **Highlight Element:** Clicking an element in the "Scan Visible Selectors" list will highlight and scroll to the corresponding element on the page.

## File Structure

The project is organized into three main files:

*   `qa-selector.html`: The main HTML file that includes the demo page content and the structure for the QA Selector Helper. It links the CSS and JavaScript files.
*   `qa-selector.css`: Contains all the styles for the QA Selector Helper popup, tooltips, overlays, and the basic styling for the demo page elements.
*   `qa-selector.js`: Holds all the JavaScript logic for the QA Selector Helper, including element scanning, selector generation, event handling, and DOM manipulation for the interactive features.

## Usage

1.  Clone or download the repository/files.
2.  Open the `qa-selector.html` file in your web browser.
3.  The QA Selector Helper popup will appear on the top right of the page.
4.  Interact with the buttons and features:
    *   Click "Scan Visible Selectors" to populate the list with elements that have an ID.
    *   Click "Enable Hover Mode" to inspect elements by hovering over them.
    *   While in Hover Mode, click the "Pin Tooltip" button (ðŸ“Œ) in the popup (it becomes active when hover mode is on) to pin the inspector tooltip to the element currently under your mouse. Click "Unpin" (ðŸ”“) to release it.
    *   Use the copy buttons (ðŸ“‹) next to each selector in the tooltip or the list to copy them.

## Configuration

Currently, the QA Selector Helper does not have a dedicated configuration file or UI for settings. Customization requires direct modification of the source code:

*   **`qa-selector.js`**:
    *   `scanVisibleSelectors()`: You could modify the initial query (e.g., `document.querySelectorAll('*[id]')`) to scan for different types of elements or attributes.
    *   `generateSelectors()`: The logic for which types of selectors are generated can be altered here.
    *   `getCSSPath()`: The method for generating the full CSS path can be customized (e.g., to prefer different attributes or avoid certain patterns).
*   **`qa-selector.css`**:
    *   The visual appearance (colors, fonts, layout) of the popup, tooltips, and highlights can be changed by modifying the CSS rules.

This tool is intended as a foundational helper and can be extended or modified to fit more specific needs.
